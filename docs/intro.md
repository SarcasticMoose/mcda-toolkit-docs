# Introduction

The MCDA Toolkit is a lightweight and flexible .NET library designed to support Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) processes. 
It assists developers and analysts in structuring, evaluating, and solving decision-making problems involving multiple, often conflicting, criteria.
The toolkit provides a streamlined interface for implementing various MCDA methods, facilitating informed and transparent decision-making

Key Features

* Cross-Platform Compatibility: Supports .NET 6 and .NET Standard 2.0 for broad applicability across different .NET environments.
* Integrated MCDA Methods: Includes implementations of well-known MCDA techniques such as TOPSIS, VIKOR, and PROMETHEE II.
* User-Friendly API: Simplifies the workflow of defining criteria, preparing decision matrices, and running analyses.

## Why MCDA Toolkit was created

This toolkit was created primarily because there were no mature or well-maintained MCDA libraries available for C# or the .NET ecosystem at the time. 
The development of this toolkit started as part of my Bachelor's engineering thesis. Initially, only the TOPSIS method was implemented as part of a larger system. 
After successfully defending my thesis, I decided not to abandon the project. Instead, I extracted its most essential and reusable components and began refactoring them into a standalone library.
This effort led to the creation of the MCDA Toolkit â€” a focused, open-source solution aimed at bringing modern, reliable multi-criteria decision analysis tools to the C#/.NET ecosystem. By separating the core logic from the original project and improving its design and usability, the toolkit became a more robust and general-purpose resource that others could benefit from as well.
