# Input data

## Structure

In a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) system, input data is crucial for evaluating and selecting the best alternative. The input data is divided into three main components:

### Decision Matrix

The **decision matrix** (commonly denoted as $M$) contains numerical values that describe how each alternative performs under various criteria.

* **Rows** represent **alternatives** (e.g., different options, projects, or solutions).
* **Columns** represent **decision criteria** (e.g., cost, quality, execution time).

#### Example:

|               | Criterion 1 | Criterion 2 | Criterion 3 |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Alternative A | 100         | 4.5         | 200         |
| Alternative B | 80          | 3.8         | 250         |
| Alternative C | 120         | 4.2         | 180         |


### Weight Vector

The **weight vector** (denoted as $W$) is a one-dimensional array of real numbers that defines the **relative importance of each criterion** in the decision-making process.

* Each value in the weight vector corresponds to one criterion.
* Weights are typically normalized (i.e., their sum equals 1), but this depends on the method used.

#### Example:

$$
W = [0.4, 0.35, 0.25]
$$


### Criterion Type Vector

The **criterion type vector** indicates the **nature of each criterion**, specifying whether the goal is to **maximize** (benefit) or **minimize** (cost) its value.

* It is typically represented using:

* **1** for **benefit** criteria (the higher, the better)
* **-1** for **cost** criteria (the lower, the better)

#### Example:

$$
T = [-1,\ 1,\ 1]
$$

This means:

* Criterion 1 is a cost (to be minimized)
* Criterion 2 is a benefit (to be maximized)
* Criterion 3 is a benefit (to be maximized)
