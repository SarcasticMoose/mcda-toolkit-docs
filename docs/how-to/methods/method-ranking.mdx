# Ranking

The `Ranking<T>` component represents a sorted structure of various options (called *alternatives*),
ordered from best to worst based on their scores. It implements the `IEnumerable<T>` interface,
allowing it to be iterated over.

A `Ranking` exposes enumerable of **ranking rows**. Each row represents one alternative and contains

```csharp showLineNumbers
public record RankingRow<T>
    where T : IComparable<T>
{
    public int Alternative { get; set; }
    public int Rank { get; set; }
    public T Score { get; set; }
}
```

- **Alternative**: A unique number identifying the option.
- **Rank**: The position in the list (1 = best).
- **Score**: A numeric value showing how well the option performed.


## Example

Here's an example of a `Ranking<double>` object with four alternatives:

```csharp showLineNumbers
var ranking = new Ranking<double>
{
    RankingItems = new List<RankingRow<double>>()
    {
        new RankingRow<double>
        {
            Alternative = 1,
            Rank = 1,
            Score = 0.371
        },
        new RankingRow<double>
        {
            Alternative = 2,
            Rank = 3,
            Score = -0.250
        },
        new RankingRow<double>
        {
            Alternative = 3,
            Rank = 4,
            Score = -0.309
        },
        new RankingRow<double>
        {
            Alternative = 4,
            Rank = 2,
            Score = 0.188
        }
    }
};
```

This ranking indicates:
- Alternative 1 is the best performing with the highest score.
- Alternatives 2 and 3 perform worse (negative scores).
- Alternative 4 is second-best.
