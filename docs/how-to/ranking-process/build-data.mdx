# Build data

The ``DefaultDataProviderBuilder`` is a utility class designed to simplify the process of constructing and providing input data to the MCDA engine. 

It serves as a builder-style interface for defining the core components required by most decision-making methods: the list of alternatives, criteria, weights, and the decision matrix.
This builder allows you to fluently configure data step by step and ensures structural integrity — for example, verifying that the number of weights matches the number of criteria, or that each alternative has a full set of evaluation scores.

Once configured, the builder produces a standardized DataProvider object, which can then be passed directly to MCDA method implementations.

```csharp showLineNumbers
var data = new DefaultDataProviderBuilder()
    .AddWeights(weights)
    .AddDecisionCriteria(types)
    .AddDecisionMatrix(matrix)
    .Build();
```
