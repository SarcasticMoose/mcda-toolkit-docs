# Data preparation

Let’s start by preparing the data — this is the essential first step in any multi-criteria decision analysis. 
Your data needs to be well-organized, consistent, and complete to ensure that the results are meaningful and useful for decision-making.

:::note

More about input data can be read on [theory docs](/mcda-toolkit-docs/docs/how-to/theory/input-data/decision-matrix)

## Decision Matrix ($M$)

The matrix is built as follows:
- rows : alternatives
- columns : decision criterion

```csharp showLineNumbers
double[,] matrix = 
{
    { 120, 1500 }, 
    { 2000, 1800 }
}
```

:::info
The data in the matrix may not be normalized, in further steps when the MCDA method is created you will be able to choose how the matrix will be normalized.

## Weights Vector ($W$)

The weights have to meet the assumption $ \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i = 1 $ where $n$ is the number of criteria (i.e. the number of columns in the decision matrix).

```csharp showLineNumbers
double[] weights = [0.5,0.5]
```

## Criteria Decision Types Vector ($C$)

They will represent as vector of $ \{ w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n \} \in [-1, 1] $, where $n$ is the number of criteria. 

* **1** for **benefit** criteria (the higher, the better)
* **-1** for **cost** criteria (the lower, the better)

```csharp showLineNumbers
int[] criteriaTypes = [-1,-1]
```
