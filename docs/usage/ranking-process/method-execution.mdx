# Execution
Each decision-making method in the toolkit implements the `IMcdaMethod<T>` interface, which exposes a single method:

```csharp
public interface IMcdaMethod<T>
{
     IResult<T> Run(McdaInputData data);
}
```

## Run
`Run()` takes previous build data of type `McdaInputData` as parameters

```csharp showLineNumbers
Ranking<T> result = method.Run(data);
```

## Stateless Execution
The `Run()` method is stateless. It does not retain any internal data state between executions *(except method internal configuration)*.
This means:
* You can reuse the same method instance multiple times.
* You can provide different input data on each call.
* There's no need to re-initialize or reset the method.

## Next Steps
To learn how to extract and interpret the results from `Ranking<T>`, see the [Ranking](final-ranking.mdx).
