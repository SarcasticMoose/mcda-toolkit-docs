# Weights

The **weight vector** (denoted as $W$) is a one-dimensional array of real numbers that defines the **relative importance of each criterion** in the decision-making process.

* Each value in the weight vector corresponds to one criterion.
* Weights have to me normalized, and always sums to `1`

#### Example:

$$
W = [0.4, 0.35, 0.25]
$$
