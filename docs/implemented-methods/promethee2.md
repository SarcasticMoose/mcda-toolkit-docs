# PROMETHEE II

PROMETHEE II (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations) is a full-ranking, outranking-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. It extends the PROMETHEE I method by providing a complete ranking of alternatives rather than only identifying partial orderings.
