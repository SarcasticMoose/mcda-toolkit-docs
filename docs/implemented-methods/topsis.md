# TOPSIS

TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a multi-criteria decision-making method.
It is based on the principle that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from the ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative-ideal solution.
