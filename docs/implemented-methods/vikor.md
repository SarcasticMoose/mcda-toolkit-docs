VIKOR (VIÅ¡ekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje) is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method that focuses on identifying a compromise solution when conflicting criteria are involved.
Developed by Serafim Opricovic in 1998, VIKOR is particularly effective when decision-makers aim to reach a solution that is closest to the ideal, but not necessarily optimal in all criteria.
